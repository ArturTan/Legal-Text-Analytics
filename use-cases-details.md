### Optical Character Recognition
Relevance: comprehensive digitalization of physical documents (from paper etc. to pdf and then into a machine-encoded text) which were created before the era of digitalization (historic documents), were/are only or had/have to be produced physically (originals with handwritten signature, notarial deeds, passports etc.).  Given that legal practice heavily relies on written information this is relevant for virtually all practice areas (litigation, contract, investigation etc.).

### Legal Document Pre-processing
Legal documents are drafted in a way (i.e., natural language) so that humans, particularly legally trained users, can understand and peruse them, usually utilizing digital means to support. Perusal of documents occurs in the context of the drafting of the relevant documents as well as in connection with the work on other matters (e.g., in the context of litigation that relates to documents. investigations). To such end the content of documents must be converted into a form that allows the relevant software to “understand” them.

### Information Extraction
As a step to machine based perusal of documents this is essential for basically all fields of legal practice given that basis for legal work essentially consists of written information which not only is structured.
